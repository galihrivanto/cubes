Configuration
+++++++++++++


Cubes workspace configuration is stored in a ``.ini`` file with sections:

* ``[workspace]`` – Cubes workspace configuration
* ``[server]`` - server related configuration, such as host, port
* ``[models]`` - list of models to be loaded 
* ``[datastore]`` – default datastore configuration
* ``[translations]`` - model translation files, option keys in this section
  are locale names and values are paths to model translation files. See
  :doc:`localization` for more information.
* ``[model]`` (depreciated) - model and cube configuration

.. note::

    The configuration has changed. Since Cubes supports multiple data stores,
    their type (backend) is specifien in the datastore configuration as
    ``type`` property, for example ``type=sql``.

Quick Start
===========

Simple configuration might look like this::

    [workspace]
    model: model.json

    [datastore]
    type: sql
    url: postgresql://localhost/database

Workspace
=========

* ``stores`` – path to a file containing store descriptions – every section is
  a store with same name as the section
* ``models_path`` – path to a directory containing models. If this is set to
  non-empty value, then all model paths specified in ``[models]`` are prefixed
  with this path
* ``log`` - path to a log file
* ``log_level`` - level of log details, from least to most: ``error``, 
    ``warn``, ``info``, ``debug``

* ``timezone`` - name of default time zone. Used in date and time operations,
  such as :ref:`named relative time <named_relative_time>`.
* ``first_weekday`` – name of first day of the week. It can also be a number
  where 0 is Monday, 6 is Sunday

* ``authorization`` – authorization method to be used

* ``lookup_method`` – cube lookup method: ``recursive`` – look for cubes
  recursively in namespaces; ``exact`` – cube has to have globally unique
  reference 

* ``info_file`` – path to JSON file containing additional server info

Models
======

Section ``[models]`` contains list of models. The property names are model
identifiers within the configuration (see ``[translations]`` for example) and
the values are paths to model files.

Example::

    [models]
    main: model.json
    mixpanel: mixpanel.json

If root ``models_path`` is specified in ``[workspace]`` then the relative
model paths are combined with the root. Example::

    [workspace]
    models_path: /dwh/cubes/models

    [models]
    main: model.json
    events: events.json

The models are loaded from ``/dwh/cubes/models/model.json`` and
``/dwh/cubes/models/events.json``.


Server
======

* ``json_record_limit`` - number of rows to limit when generating JSON 
    output with iterable objects, such as facts. Default is 1000. It is 
    recommended to use alternate response format, such as CSV, to get more 
    records.
* ``modules`` - space separated list of modules to be loaded (only used if 
    run by the ``slicer`` command)
* ``prettyprint`` - default value of ``prettyprint`` parameter. Set to 
    ``true`` for demonstration purposes.
* ``host`` - host where the server runs, defaults to ``localhost``
* ``port`` - port on which the server listens, defaults to ``5000``
* ``allow_cors_origin`` – Cross-origin resource sharing header. Other related
  headers are added as well, if this option is present.

* ``authentication`` – authentication method (see below for more information)

* ``pid_file`` – path to a file where PID of the running server will be
  written. If not provided, no PID file is created.

Model
=====

.. note::

    This section is depreciated. Use `model` in ``[workspace]`` for single
    model file or ``[models]`` for multiple models.

* ``path`` - path to model .json file
* ``locales`` - comma separated list of locales the model is provided in. 
    Currently this variable is optional and it is used only by experimental 
    sphinx search backend.

Data stores
===========

There might be one or more datastores configured. The section ``[datastore]``
of the ``cubes.ini`` file describes the default store. Multiple stores are
configured in a separate ``stores.ini`` file. The path to the stores
configuration file might be specified in a variable ``stores`` of the
``[workspace]`` section

The store configuration has to have at least one property: ``type``. Rest of
the properties are handled by the actual data store.

Other optional store options:

* ``model`` – name of the model for the store
* ``model_provider`` – type of the model provider for the store (the model
  provider will be connected this store)
* ``namespace`` – namespace that will be used for objects in the model for the
  store

SQL store
---------

Example SQL store::

    [datastore]
    type: sql
    url: postgresql://localhost/data
    schema: cubes

For more information and configuration options see :doc:`backends/sql`.


Example
=======

Example configuration file::

    [workspace]
    model: ~/models/contracts_model.json

    [server]
    reload: yes
    log: /var/log/cubes.log
    log_level: info

    [datastore]
    type: sql
    url: postgresql://localhost/data
    schema: cubes

Authentication and Authorization
================================

Cubes provides mechanisms for authentication at the server side and
authorization at the workspace side.

Configure authorization:

.. code-block:: ini

    [workspace]
    authorization: simple

    [authorization]
    rights_file: /path/to/access_rights.json

Built-in authorization methods:

* ``none`` – no authorization
* ``simple`` – uses a JSON file with per-user access rights

The simple authorization has following options:

* ``rights_file`` – path to the file with access rights
* ``roles_file`` – path to the file with roles
* ``identity_dimension`` – name of a flat dimension that will be used for cell
  restriction. Key of that dimension should match the identity.
* ``order`` – ``allow_deny`` or ``deny_allow`` (default)
* ``guest`` – name of a guest role. If specified, then this role will be used
  for all unknown (not specified in the file) roles.

Configure authentication:

.. code-block:: ini

    [server]
    authentication: parameter

    [authentication]
    # additional authentication parameters

Built-in server authentication methods:

* ``none`` – no authentication
* ``http_basic_proxy`` – HTTP basic authentication. Will pass the `username`
  to the authorizer
* ``pass_parameter`` – authentication withot verification, just a way of
  passing an URL parameter to the authorizer. Default parameter name is
  ``api_key``

.. note::

    When you have authorization method specified and is based on an users's
    indentity, then you have to specify the authentication method in the
    server. Otherwise the authorizer will not receive any identity and might
    refuse any access.


Server Query Logging
====================

Logging handlers for server requests have sections with name prefix
`query_log`. All sections with this prefix (including section named as the
prefix) are collected and chained into a list of logging handlers. Required
option is `type`. You might have multiple handlers of the same time.

Logging types:

* `default` – log using Cubes logger
* `csv_file` – log into a CSV file
* `sql` – log into a SQL table

CSV request logger options:

* `path` – path to a CSV file that will be appended (and created if necessary)

SQL request logger options:

* `url` – database URL
* `table` – database table
* `dimensions_table` – table with dimension use (optional)

Tables are created automatically.
